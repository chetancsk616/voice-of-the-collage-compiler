  "detailedDescription": "Write a program that calculates the height of a binary tree. The height is the number of edges on the longest path from root to leaf. An empty tree has height -1, and a tree with single node has height 0. Input format: First line contains number of nodes, followed by node values in level-order (use -1 for null).",
  "hints": [
    "Height of tree = 1 + max(height of left subtree, height of right subtree)",
    "Base case: empty tree returns -1",
    "Use recursion for elegant solution",
    "Consider using queue for level-order tree construction"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Confusing height with depth",
    "Not handling empty tree case",
    "Off-by-one errors in counting edges vs nodes",
    "Not properly constructing tree from input"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Build the tree from level-order input, then recursively compute height by finding max of left and right subtree heights plus 1. Handle null nodes appropriately.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must correctly calculate height for various tree structures including empty, single node, balanced, and skewed trees",
