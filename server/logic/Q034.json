  "detailedDescription": "Given n activities with start and end times, select maximum number of non-overlapping activities. Input: First line has n. Next n lines have start and end times. Output: Maximum number of activities that can be selected. Sort by end time, greedily select non-overlapping activities.",
  "hints": [
    "Sort activities by end time",
    "Greedily select activity that ends earliest",
    "Next activity must start after current ends",
    "This greedy approach gives optimal solution"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Sorting by start time instead of end time",
    "Using dynamic programming (overcomplicating)",
    "Not handling overlapping boundaries correctly",
    "Incorrect activity comparison"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Sort activities by end time. Select first activity. For remaining activities: if start time >= last selected end time, select it. Count total selected activities.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must achieve optimal selection. Should handle various overlapping patterns.",
