  "detailedDescription": "Build Huffman tree for optimal prefix-free encoding. Input: Number of characters, then character-frequency pairs. Output: Total encoding cost (sum of frequency * depth for all chars). Use min heap to build tree greedily by combining lowest frequency nodes.",
  "hints": [
    "Use min heap with character frequencies",
    "Repeatedly extract two minimum nodes",
    "Create parent with combined frequency",
    "Insert parent back to heap",
    "Continue until one node remains (root)"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Not using min heap (incorrect tree)",
    "Wrong cost calculation",
    "Not combining nodes correctly",
    "Incorrect parent frequency"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Insert all characters with frequencies to min heap. While heap size > 1: extract two min nodes, create parent with sum of frequencies, insert parent. Calculate total cost by traversing tree.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must build optimal Huffman tree. Total cost should be minimum possible. Should demonstrate greedy construction.",
