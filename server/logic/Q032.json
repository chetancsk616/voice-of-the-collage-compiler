  "disallowedPatterns": ["array_storage", "hash_set_only"],
  "expectedTimeComplexity": "O(m)",
  "expectedSpaceComplexity": "O(total characters)",
  "paradigm": "Trie",
  "constraints": {
    "minLineCount": 20,
    "maxLineCount": 60,
    "shouldReadInput": true,
    "shouldUseLoops": true,

  },
  "detailedDescription": "Implement Trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods. Input: Number of operations followed by commands (insert word, search word, startsWith prefix). Output: Results of search and startsWith as true/false. Each node has children and isEndOfWord flag.",
  "hints": [
    "Each node has 26 children (for a-z) or hashmap",
    "Insert: traverse/create path for each character",
    "Search: traverse path, check if last node is end of word",
    "StartsWith: traverse path, return true if path exists"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Not marking end of word correctly",
    "Confusing search and startsWith logic",
    "Not handling null children properly",
    "Inefficient child node storage"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "TrieNode has children array/map and isEndOfWord flag. Insert: traverse trie, create nodes as needed, mark last as end. Search: traverse, check end flag. StartsWith: just check if path exists.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "All operations must be O(m) where m is word length. Should correctly distinguish between search and prefix matching.",
