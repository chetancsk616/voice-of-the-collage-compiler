  "detailedDescription": "Find starting and ending position of target in sorted array with duplicates. Input: First line has n and target. Second line has n sorted integers (may have duplicates). Output: Two indices representing first and last occurrence, or -1 -1 if not found. Use modified binary search.",
  "hints": [
    "Perform two binary searches: one for leftmost, one for rightmost",
    "For leftmost: when found, continue searching left half",
    "For rightmost: when found, continue searching right half",
    "Both searches should be O(log n)"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Using linear search after finding first occurrence",
    "Not handling duplicates correctly",
    "Single binary search not finding bounds",
    "Incorrect boundary updates"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "First binary search finds leftmost occurrence: when target found, update result and continue searching left (high=mid-1). Second binary search finds rightmost: when found, update result and search right (low=mid+1).",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must find both positions in O(log n) time. Should handle arrays with all duplicates, no target, and single occurrence.",
