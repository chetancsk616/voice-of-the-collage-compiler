  "detailedDescription": "Detect if undirected graph contains cycle using Union Find (Disjoint Set Union). Input: Number of vertices and edges, followed by edge pairs. Output: 'true' if cycle exists, 'false' otherwise. If both vertices of edge in same set, cycle exists.",
  "hints": [
    "Union Find with path compression and union by rank",
    "For each edge: find parent of both vertices",
    "If parents same, cycle exists",
    "Otherwise, union the two sets"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Using DFS/BFS instead of Union Find",
    "Not implementing path compression",
    "Not using union by rank (inefficient)",

  "solutionApproach": "Initialize parent and rank arrays. For each edge (u,v): find parent of u and v. If same parent, cycle exists. Otherwise, union their sets. Use path compression in find and union by rank.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must use Union Find data structure. Should efficiently detect cycles. Handle disconnected graphs.",
