  "detailedDescription": "Find all dictionary words that can be formed in 2D board (horizontal/vertical adjacent cells). Input: Board dimensions, board grid, number of words, word list. Output: All found words from dictionary. Build Trie from words, then DFS from each cell.",
  "hints": [
    "Build Trie from all dictionary words first",
    "DFS from each board cell, following Trie paths",
    "Mark cells visited during current path",
    "When reaching end-of-word node, add to results",
    "More efficient than searching each word separately"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Searching each word separately (slower)",
    "Not marking visited cells",
    "Not backtracking properly",
    "Adding duplicate words to results"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Build Trie from dictionary. For each board cell: DFS with current Trie node. If cell char matches child, recurse to neighbors with child node. Mark visited, backtrack. Collect words at end nodes.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must find all valid words efficiently. Should handle overlapping words and various board sizes.",
