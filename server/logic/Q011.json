  "detailedDescription": "Find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings. A subsequence is a sequence derived by deleting some or no elements without changing order. Input: Two strings on separate lines. Output: Length of LCS. Example: LCS of 'ABCDGH' and 'AEDFHR' is 'ADH' (length 3).",
  "hints": [
    "Use 2D DP table: dp[i][j] = LCS length of first i chars of string1 and first j chars of string2",
    "If chars match: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1",
    "If chars don't match: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])",
    "Initialize first row and column to 0"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Confusing subsequence with substring",
    "Incorrect DP transition formula",
    "Not handling empty strings",
    "Off-by-one errors in table indexing"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Create (m+1)x(n+1) DP table. For each position: if characters match, take diagonal value + 1; else take max of left and top. Return dp[m][n].",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must correctly compute LCS length for various string pairs including empty strings, identical strings, and strings with no common subsequence.",
