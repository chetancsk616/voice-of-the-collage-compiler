  "detailedDescription": "Find all occurrences of pattern in text using KMP algorithm. Input: Text string on first line, pattern on second line. Output: Indices where pattern occurs (space-separated), or -1 if not found. KMP uses LPS (Longest Proper Prefix which is also Suffix) array to avoid redundant comparisons.",
  "hints": [
    "Build LPS array for pattern: tracks longest proper prefix that is also suffix",
    "LPS helps skip already matched characters on mismatch",
    "When mismatch: use LPS to determine next comparison position",
    "No backtracking in text needed"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Using naive O(n*m) pattern matching",
    "Incorrect LPS array construction",
    "Not utilizing LPS on mismatch",
    "Using built-in string find function"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Build LPS array for pattern. Scan text with two pointers (text and pattern). On match, advance both. On mismatch: if pattern pointer > 0, use LPS to reset pattern pointer; else advance text pointer. Record matches when pattern fully matched.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must use KMP algorithm. Should achieve O(n+m) time. Find all occurrences correctly.",
