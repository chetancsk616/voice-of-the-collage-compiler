  "detailedDescription": "Implement a queue using only two stacks. Support enqueue, dequeue, and front operations. Input: Number of operations followed by commands (enqueue x, dequeue, front). Output: Results of dequeue and front operations. Must use only stack operations (push/pop).",
  "hints": [
    "Use two stacks: inbox (for enqueue) and outbox (for dequeue)",
    "Enqueue pushes to inbox",
    "Dequeue: if outbox empty, transfer all from inbox to outbox, then pop",
    "Amortized O(1) time per operation"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Transferring elements on every operation",
    "Not maintaining FIFO order",
    "Using array or built-in queue",
    "Incorrect handling of empty queue"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Two stacks: inbox and outbox. Enqueue pushes to inbox. Dequeue: if outbox empty, pop all from inbox and push to outbox, then pop from outbox. Front: peek outbox top after ensuring it's populated.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must implement queue using only stack operations. Should maintain correct FIFO order through various enqueue/dequeue sequences.",
