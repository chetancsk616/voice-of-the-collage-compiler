  "detailedDescription": "Count connected components in undirected graph using Union Find. Input: Number of vertices and edges, followed by edge pairs. Output: Number of connected components. Initially each vertex is separate component. Each union reduces component count by 1.",
  "hints": [
    "Start with component count = number of vertices",
    "For each edge, union the two vertices",
    "If vertices in different sets, union reduces component count",
    "Use find with path compression"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Not initializing component count correctly",
    "Decrementing count when vertices already in same set",
    "Not implementing union find properly",
    "Using DFS instead of Union Find"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Initialize Union Find, components=n. For each edge: find parents of both vertices. If different parents, union them and decrement components. Return final component count.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must use Union Find. Should correctly count components. Handle fully connected and completely disconnected graphs.",
