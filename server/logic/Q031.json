  "detailedDescription": "Find all unique triplets [a, b, c] where a + b + c = 0. Input: First line has n. Second line has n integers. Output: All unique triplets (one per line). Sort array first, then for each element, use two pointers to find pairs summing to its negative.",
  "hints": [
    "Sort array first",
    "Fix first element, use two pointers for remaining two",
    "Skip duplicates to avoid duplicate triplets",
    "Two pointers converge based on sum comparison"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Three nested loops (O(n³))",
    "Not handling duplicates",
    "Not sorting array first",
    "Including same triplet multiple times"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Sort array. For each i from 0 to n-3: target = -nums[i]. Use two pointers (left=i+1, right=n-1) to find pairs summing to target. Skip duplicates for all three positions.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must find all unique triplets in O(n²) time. No duplicate triplets in output.",
