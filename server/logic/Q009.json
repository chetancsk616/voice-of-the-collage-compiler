  "detailedDescription": "Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) for a graph. Input: Number of vertices and edges, followed by edge pairs, then starting vertex. Output: DFS traversal order. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.",
  "hints": [
    "Can use recursion or explicit stack",
    "Mark vertices as visited",
    "Visit vertex, then recursively visit all unvisited neighbors",
    "Use adjacency list representation"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Using queue instead of stack/recursion (becomes BFS)",
    "Not maintaining visited set",
    "Incorrect backtracking logic",
    "Wrong graph representation"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Build adjacency list. Implement DFS recursively: mark current vertex visited, print it, then recursively call DFS on all unvisited neighbors. Base case: all neighbors visited.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must produce valid DFS order (different from BFS). Should handle cycles. Must visit each vertex once.",
