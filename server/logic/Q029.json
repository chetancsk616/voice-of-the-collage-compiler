  "detailedDescription": "Find length of longest substring without repeating characters. Input: A string. Output: Length of longest substring with all unique characters. Example: 'abcabcbb' → 3 ('abc'). Use sliding window with hash set.",
  "hints": [
    "Use hash set to track characters in current window",
    "Expand window by adding characters if not in set",
    "When duplicate found, shrink window from left until duplicate removed",
    "Track maximum window size seen"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Using nested loops (O(n²))",
    "Not removing characters when shrinking window",
    "Incorrect window size calculation",
    "Not handling empty string"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Two pointers: left and right. Expand right, add char to set. If duplicate, shrink from left until duplicate removed. Track max window size (right - left + 1).",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must achieve O(n) time. Should handle all unique characters, all same character, and empty string.",
