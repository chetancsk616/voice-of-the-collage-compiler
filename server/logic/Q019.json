  "detailedDescription": "Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted list. Input: First line has k (number of lists). Next k lines have space-separated sorted integers (each list). Output: Single merged sorted list. Use min-heap containing one element from each list for optimal performance.",
  "hints": [
    "Use min-heap to track smallest element from each list",
    "Initialize heap with first element from each list",
    "Extract min, add to result, insert next element from same list",
    "Better than merging lists pairwise repeatedly"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Merging all elements then sorting (O(N log N) not optimal)",
    "Merging lists pairwise without optimization",
    "Not tracking which list each element came from",
    "Incorrect heap implementation"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Create min-heap with first element from each list (store value and list index). While heap not empty: extract min, add to result, insert next element from same list into heap. Result is merged sorted list.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must efficiently merge k lists. Output must be fully sorted. Time complexity should be O(N log k) where N is total elements.",
