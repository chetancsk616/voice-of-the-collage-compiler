  "detailedDescription": "Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) for a graph. Input: First line has number of vertices and edges. Next lines have edge pairs. Then starting vertex. Output: BFS traversal order starting from given vertex. Use queue to explore vertices level by level.",
  "hints": [
    "Use queue data structure for BFS",
    "Mark vertices as visited to avoid cycles",
    "Enqueue starting vertex, then process neighbors level by level",
    "Use adjacency list for graph representation"

  "commonMistakes": [
    "Using stack instead of queue (becomes DFS)",
    "Not marking vertices as visited",

  "testCaseCriteria": "Must produce correct BFS order. Should handle disconnected graphs. Must not revisit vertices.",
