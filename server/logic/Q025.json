  "detailedDescription": "Solve N-Queens problem: place n queens on n×n chessboard so no two queens attack each other. Queens attack on same row, column, or diagonal. Input: Integer n (board size). Output: Number of valid solutions, followed by one solution as n lines of n characters ('Q' for queen, '.' for empty). Use backtracking with constraint checking.",
  "hints": [
    "Place one queen per row to avoid row conflicts",
    "Check column and diagonal conflicts before placing",
    "Use backtracking: try each column, recurse, backtrack if fails",
    "Track used columns, diagonals for O(1) conflict checking"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Not checking diagonal attacks",
    "Inefficient conflict checking",
    "Not backtracking properly",
    "Missing some valid solutions"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Recursive backtracking placing row by row. For each row, try each column: if safe (no column/diagonal conflict), place queen, recurse to next row. If successful, found solution. Backtrack by removing queen. Track used columns and diagonals for efficiency.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must find valid N-Queens solutions. Queens must not attack each other. Should demonstrate backtracking with pruning.",
