  "detailedDescription": "Find longest palindromic substring in given string. Input: A string. Output: The longest palindromic substring (if multiple, any one). Use expand around center: for each position, expand outward while characters match. Consider both odd and even length palindromes.",
  "hints": [
    "Each character can be center of odd-length palindrome",
    "Each pair of adjacent characters can be center of even-length palindrome",
    "Expand around each possible center",
    "Track longest palindrome found"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Checking all substrings (O(n³))",
    "Not considering even-length palindromes",
    "Incorrect expansion logic",
    "Not handling single character strings"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "For each index i: expand around i (odd-length) and around i,i+1 (even-length). While characters match, expand outward. Track longest palindrome. Return substring with max length.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must find correct longest palindrome. Should handle both odd and even length. O(n²) time acceptable.",
