  "difficulty": "Medium",

  "algorithmDescription": "Implement stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving minimum element in O(1)",

  "detailedDescription": "Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and getMin operations in O(1) time. Input: Number of operations followed by operation commands (push x, pop, top, getMin). Output: Results of top and getMin operations. Use auxiliary stack to track minimums.",
  "hints": [
    "Use two stacks: main stack and min stack",
    "Min stack stores minimum at each level",
    "Push to min stack only if value <= current min",
    "Pop from min stack when popped value equals current min"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Scanning entire stack to find minimum (O(n))",
    "Not maintaining min stack correctly",
    "Incorrect handling of duplicate minimums",
    "Not synchronizing main and min stacks"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Maintain two stacks. Main stack stores all elements. Min stack stores minimums. On push, if value <= min stack top, push to both. On pop, if popped equals min stack top, pop from both. getMin returns min stack top.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "All operations must run in O(1) time. Must correctly track minimum through various push/pop sequences.",
