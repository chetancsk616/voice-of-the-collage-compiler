  "detailedDescription": "Given n heights, find two lines that form container with maximum water. Area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i). Input: First line has n. Second line has n heights. Output: Maximum water area. Use two pointers starting at ends.",
  "hints": [
    "Start with pointers at both ends (maximum width)",
    "Area limited by shorter line",
    "Move pointer at shorter line inward (might find taller line)",
    "Track maximum area seen"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Checking all pairs (O(n²))",
    "Moving wrong pointer",
    "Incorrect area calculation",
    "Not considering width decrease"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Two pointers: left=0, right=n-1. Calculate area with min height and width. Move pointer with smaller height inward. Repeat until pointers meet, tracking max area.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must achieve O(n) time. Should find optimal container area efficiently.",
