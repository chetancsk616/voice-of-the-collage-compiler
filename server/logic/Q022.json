  "detailedDescription": "Given array of integers and target sum, find indices of two numbers that add up to target. Input: First line has n and target. Second line has n integers. Output: Two indices (0-based) of numbers that sum to target. Use hash table for O(n) solution. Assume exactly one solution exists.",
  "hints": [
    "Use hash table to store seen numbers and their indices",
    "For each number x, check if (target - x) exists in hash table",
    "If found, return current index and stored index",
    "Single pass through array"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Using nested loops (O(n²))",
    "Sorting array first (destroys indices)",
    "Not handling duplicate values correctly",
    "Using same element twice"
  ],
  "solutionApproach": "Create hash table. Iterate through array: for each number, calculate complement (target - number). If complement in hash table, return indices. Otherwise, store current number and index in hash table.",
  "testCaseCriteria": "Must find correct indices in O(n) time. Should handle various array sizes and targets. Must use hash table.",
